<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>December 2023 was a big one for me. I completed a project at work I have been
working on for the last 3 years. What I did and what the project was about is
doubly-irrelevant for this blog. For the first, in my line of business one is
not supposed to talk shop in the public. For the second, I ultimately do not
care.</p>
<figure style="float:right; width:50%; margin-right: 0.25em;">
  <img alt="Pyramid and UFOs" src="/pyramid_ufos.png" />
  <figcaption><small>At least some of the ways of working of ancient Egyptians
  seem alien to us.</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I argue that the biggest blunder of my generation is to insist that work should
have some deep fulfilling meaning. I think this is asking too much. For the
purposes of one&rsquo;s mental health, it is sufficient that it make some sense most
of the time. Just think about the pyramids in Egypt. They look miraculous not
only as physical objects but also as reminders of the work of countless hordes
of people. Yet, at least I struggle to find any meaning in them.</p>
<p>Imagine the construction site of a pyramid. There were a handful of assholes who
whipped the slaves and thereby denied themselves the pride of having actually
created something really beautiful with their own hands, for there are more
beautiful things in this world than scars. Then there were the slaves who did
not fight back despite being in the majority, so denying themselves the logic of
arithmetic. And finally there was the dead pharaoh whom they all worshipped and
who was at the same time absent and omnipresent.</p>
<p>Some progress has surely been made in the last 5000 years as at least some of
the passage seems alien to us. The basic power structure has nonetheless
remained the same. There is the absent but omnipresent boss. There is the middle
management. And then there are the doers. To make matters worse, if I left it at
that, I would already manifest some ideology because ideologies are defined by
their boundaries — they are born whenever certain people are left out and they
are born whenever people <em>feel</em> they are left out. Of course there were the
countless people I omitted. There were the multitude of bakers, whores, cooks,
brewers and so forth working amidst the biblical swarms of flies.</p>
<p>I am afraid that as long as there are pesky insects there will be ideologies
which ultimately serve the same purpose of sucking drops of our life energy from
us. But there is still some hope. If we leave meaning by the wayside, it still
makes a difference <em>how</em> we work. That I do care about in a deep way. It is also
something that I have been thinking and studying for the past years. You could
even say that my last project was an experiment whose final report this blog
post is. It is only now that I am able to connect the dots.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, it only took one good book to sum up all the wisdom I have
gathered over the years. What do you know, work and equitability are topics that
have vexed the minds of many thinkers in the past! My role here is to merely
raise my hand up and tell you that I got the lesson. If I&rsquo;m lucky, I&rsquo;ll get you
to read the book I&rsquo;m talking about:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352">Roger Fisher, William L. Ury, Bruce Patton: Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</a>.</p>
<p>You see, it was only quite recently that I realized that I have been trying to
be a <em>principled negotiator</em> all along. I finally see that there are more
fundamental aspects to organizing work than what usually falls under the
umbrella of <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> that I once studied so hard.</p>
<p>In particular, it has become apparent to me that the benefits promised by agile
methodologies are subject to how well the work is lead which in turn is in large
part about how you negotiate. In other words, the work can be as agile as your
HR department declares, no doubt based on some arbitrary set of metrics, but
without proper leadership, the work will be mostly about fixing defects and ways
to masquerade confusion with agile jargon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Cpt. Obvious&rdquo;, you might say, &ldquo;any more of these truths that you would
like to vent out?&rdquo; Well, let me try to be constructive and put some flesh on the
bones of my argument by summarizing what Fisher, Ury and Patton discuss in their
book. I want to talk about how to get the most of agile by following the four
key principles the authors present.</p>
<p>As an aside, <em>Getting to Yes</em> is a real page-turner. It contains a lot of
real-life examples of conflicts, from car insurance disputes to full-fledged
wars. No wonder the book is is a perennial best-seller and a classic among the
business-savvy. Reading the book, I felt like eavesdropping on the training
material for lawyers and business executives. Indeed, the authors
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Fisher_(academic)">Roger Fisher</a> and
<a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/william-ury/">William Ury</a> are the founders
of the Harvard Programme on Negotiation.</p>
<p>The authors have also published a whole host of sequels to the original book.
There is <em>Getting to Yes with Yourself</em> for the self-help market and <em>Getting
Past No</em> for those who did not get to yes. Then there is <em>Getting It DONE: How
to Lead When You&rsquo;re Not in Charge</em> whose title would be perfect for this blog,
with a tongue in cheek reference to
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and everything. Being aware of
the copyrights of the authors, I suppose they would be nonetheless cool if I
stick to their formula and call this blog the next best thing: &ldquo;Getting to
Deploy: Negotiating A Sprint Without Giving In&rdquo;.</p>

  <img alt="Cover of Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981)" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/Getting_to_Yes.jpg" />
  <figcaption><small>The cover of the first edition of Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (1981)</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The theory of negotiation as presented in <em>Getting to Yes</em> is rather
straightforward. Negotiation is a process that aims at an agreement. While good
negotiators approach their work from a humans-first point of view, good
interpersonal skills alone will not lead to wise agreements. The agreement
should be formulated as a solution to a problem that can be described in a
rational way. This does not imply a dichotomy between reason and emotions. It
merely means that good negotiators are emotionally intelligent. If for example
some aspect of the agreement involves &ldquo;saving face&rdquo;, a good negotiator knows how
to factor this in their arguments without getting caught up in their own pride.</p>
<p>In a software development context, the situation is also rather straightforward.
It is often easy to point at the problem: the software does not exist, it lacks
a feature or is found to be defective. The situation gets a lot more interesting
when dealing with distributed systems. When a new feature requires a
modification in another piece of software, developers need to meet and
negotiate.</p>
<p>The authors of <em>Getting to Yes</em> go to great lengths at describing the crippling
effects of <em>positional bargaining</em>. This means a situation where the negotiating
parties go down the path of offers and counteroffers where the stronger party
will most likely have the final say. I recognize the situation. In software
development, it takes the form of &ldquo;backlog-driven development&rdquo;. Rather than
trying to solve the problem in a rational way, the solution is based on how
little work ends up in <em>my</em> team&rsquo;s backlog.</p>
<p>The first step in being principled about these negotiations is to separate
people problems from the problem itself. As far as the problem itself goes, it
is necessary to do due diligence and read the documentation on the architecture
and system design. These are the documents that should show what the principles
are. No architecture documentation? Well, a principled negotiator should forget
about the original problem and start to work on getting the documentation. I
have once received it in the form of an <em>ad hoc</em> puppet show where the marker
pens in the meeting room played the role of actors and miscellaneous office
trinkets played the role of APIs.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to be mindful of what the goal of software architecture is
in the first place. It is to create cohesive components that depend on
abstractions. As software architects are typically more on the introverted side
and possess strong system thinking capabilities, it is no wonder that the ideal
situation is to minimize dependencies in the first place — then the need to
negotiate is minimized as well. It therefore pays to understand that starting a
negotiation has already a hidden psychological cost associated to it. In
general, software architects are not like the jolly hagglers you encounter in
the bazaars of the Orient. The starting point of a negotiation is often that we
have a leaky abstraction on our hands.</p>
<p>If we then focus on the people problems, I suppose they are not that different
from any other discipline. Too much work, too little time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmersarealsohuman5909">Programmers are also human</a>.</p>
<p>The one aspect of time pressure I want to highlight has to do with what agile
aficionados have been championing all along. Namely, it is necessary to leave
some slack in the day-to-day work so that developers have the mental capacity to
approach problems creatively. I remember reading about &ldquo;80% capacity&rdquo; being
optimal, but cannot give you better sources except
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">&ldquo;Pareto&rsquo;s principle&rdquo;</a>
accompanied by my jazz hands.</p>
<p>The people problem can also be about bad timing. These feature request meetings
have the tendency to emerge randomly, and sometimes it just happens that
something is amuck in production at the same day, which creates an emotionally
unproductive setting for collaboration. Again, factoring in the necessary time
to let things cool down is what gives better results. For example, I have found
it useful to start from asking when people are on holidays. It is a far better
ice breaker question than &ldquo;when do you have free time to do this annoying thing
I would need from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, I should also add that a negotiation that ends with wishful thinking
about fixing the problem properly sometime in the future does not constitute a
real agreement. It is as realistic as expecting shards of glass to spontaneously
jump together to make a vase. To be principled in these matters is to deal with
real timetables and real commitments.</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-interests-not-positions">Focus on interests, not positions</h2>
<p>I once watched a very interesting analysis of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3aK-EK5V2k">The Cats</a>, the musical and the
movie. The analysis starts by claiming that songs in musicals can be roughly
divided into two classes. There are the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; songs and the &ldquo;I want&rdquo; songs. The
villains typically sing the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; songs which help to establish their nefarious
nature and hide their true interests. The heroes on the other hand sing songs
about what they aspire to be or what they wish to accomplish. The end result is
then that The Cats is the ultimate musical as it consists of many hours of
boring &ldquo;I am&rdquo; songs by the different cats as they introduce themselves, followed
by one hell of a &ldquo;I want&rdquo; song —
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gd_ohoPzYc">Memory</a>.</p>
<p>This observation has a parallel in the world of negotiation. If the story is
about who is who, it ends quite quickly and lacks all of the momentum a good
story has. If on the hand, we give a voice to the characters and let them
describe what they want, the story starts to unfold almost on its own. The same
applies to negotiating.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you want to play the villain in a negotiation, the recipe is to just
describe your position and then shut up. To be a principled negotiator means to
arrange the negotiation so that participants are encouraged to describe their
interests. They need to be given the chance to be the heroes of the story.</p>
<figure style="float:right;width:360px;">

  <figcaption><small>DJ Shadow: Nobody speak. A song about an unprincipled negotiation.</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result is then obviously a conflict as not all interests can be satisfied.
It is a fact of human existence that we value different things and end up
bickering about the small stuff. However, somehow we nonetheless thrive because
of these conflicting interests. The authors of <em>Getting to Yes</em> point out in a
very illuminating fashion that a conflict of interest is often the prerequisite
for reaching an agreement in the first place. Just think about it. A cabbage
peddler in the proverbial bazaar has to value money more than their produce in
order to sell it.</p>
<p>In my experience, software development is in no way different from the general
case. It is helpful to consciously try to encourage people to state their
interests. Sometimes the negotiation gets stuck as people formulate their
interests based on other people&rsquo;s interests. They perhaps lack the courage to be
so selfish as they privately would like to be. Another bone of contention is
that some people would like to be told what to do while others prefer autonomy.</p>
<p>However, after the interests are known, I have more often than once witnessed a
miraculous event. The solution to the problem at hand just pops out of nowhere.
For example, if a developer identifies the location of the problem in the source
code during the negotiation, it can sometimes happen that the fix is just a
minor tweak that is deployed to the test environment by the end of the meeting.</p>
<h2 id="invent-options-for-mutual-gain">Invent options for mutual gain</h2>
<p>The third aspect of being a disciplined negotiator is to understand that our
collective capacity to solve problems is damn near infinite. If we were forced
to rebuild the pyramids, we could easily do it at a fraction of the cost spent
in the war in Ukraine. Yet, the obvious question would be whom would this
benefit. <em>Cui bono?</em></p>
<p>The authors of <em>Getting to Yes</em> map out a strategy to seek the coveted &ldquo;win-win&rdquo;
that is the mark of a good agreement. The idea is to separate the problem
solving capacity of all the stakeholders from the stressful grind of the
negotiation proper.</p>
<p>As anybody who likes negotiation is sure to admit, the process has a component
of an ego trip to it. My intuition tells me that introverted people underperform
in these situations despite often having superior substantive understanding of
the problem at hand. By the same token, people&rsquo;s stress coping skills are not
the same as their problem solving skills. It is therefore beneficial to create
an environment where every stakeholder can contribute irrespective of how power
hungry they are.</p>
<p>The practical solution is then to have separate <em>workshops</em> leading up to the
<em>negotiation</em>. The workshops are solely about throwing out ideas. It is then an
indicator of psychological safety how creative and wild the ideas are. These
workshops help to reduce the solution to a finite set of candidates, each with
agreed upon pros and cons. This is an effective strategy because it involves
reaching pre-agreements about the different alternatives so that the final
agreement is reduced to picking a solution out of a menu based on the best
possible knowledge that was available.</p>
<p>The strategy also reminds me of
<a href="/posts/better-code-nov-2022/">my previous post about how to program well</a>. Once
again we see that we humans are good at tackling a problem if it is of the
&ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; type.</p>
<p>However, I recognize that this chapter is a bit idealistic in the context of
software development. The tricky part is that in real software projects there is
often no sense of strong psychological safety: developers can easily feel that
they are not being heard. It is very much like in the poem
<a href="https://runosto.net/eino-leino/tahtitarha/se-kuitenkin-liikkuu/">&ldquo;It still moves&rdquo; by Eino Leino</a>:
&ldquo;When the gentle is put amidst the rough, it is often the rough who prevail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have participated in all kinds of workshops that had the grand goal of
figuring out the best alternatives so that powers that be could decide the
proper course of action. In truth, I always felt I was wasting my time. From a
software developer&rsquo;s point of view, the solutions can be expressed rather simply
in software terms. It is an unsolved problem how to communicate this to business
owners who think in terms of budgets and resources. It seems that in reality
there are only two options for mutual gain. Either we developers acquire MBA
degrees from some Caribbean online university or business owners take on
<a href="https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/programming-web-design/java/java-for-dummies-2-281748/">&ldquo;Java for dummies&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insist-on-using-objective-criteria">Insist on using objective criteria</h2>
<p>Finally, the last aspect of being a principled negotiator is in my opinion the
most important one with regard to agile ways of working. It has also a lot to do
with buzzwords like <em>lean manufacturing</em>, <em>CI/CD</em> and <em>DevOps</em>.</p>
<p>The wet dream of anybody working in the enterprise is surely to have an entire
day free of any distractions. This is simple in theory but difficult in
practice. All one would need to do is to decline to attend the meetings that
creep in our calendars. The authors of <em>Getting to Yes</em> discuss in length how to
deal with this issue. The authors instruct to be always aware of one&rsquo;s <em>BATNA</em>,
the Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement.</p>
<p>If your BATNA is better than what can be achieved by participated in the
meeting, there is no need to negotiate. If you can limit your work in progress
to one thing, your primary interest should be to get that piece of work done. If
the meeting does not advance that goal, there is no need to attend it. Mind you,
if you attend meetings muted, you are a villain. I recognize the harshness of my
tone, but I am frankly fed up with people who fail to apply any of the thinking
behind agile in practice. Their calendars look like a mess. There should be a
separate negotiation guide for the extremely agreeable: <em>Saying No: A little bit
of self-interest goes a long way</em>.</p>
<p>I have been in several heated and unresolved debates about this matter. I am
willing to admit that not all people in the enterprise have the luxury to focus
on one thing at the time. The pressure to multitask is many orders of magnitude
stronger when moving from a software team level to a whole business unit.
However, my argument, as corroborated by <em>Getting to Yes</em>, remains. It pays to
consider if negotiation is even required. Instead of even trying to agree, the
BATNA should be that there is an pre-existing agreement, a procedure, on how to
get a particular thing done. Sounds a lot like good governance to me.</p>
<p>Suppose you limit your time to the negotiations that actually matter. The
authors of <em>Getting to Yes</em> further stress to insist on objective criteria as a
basis of reaching an agreement. This has the effect of further freeing up time
from your calendar. Just take a look at it. How many of the meetings last week
were essentially about the back and forth among people who do not understand
what was agreed upon?</p>
<figure style="float:right; width:40%; margin-right: 0.25em;">
  <img alt="Jeff Sutherland on Acceptance Tests" src="/uat.jpg" />
  <figcaption><small>Acceptance test as the objective criteria</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Principled negotiators recognize that a hidden motivation in reaching an
agreement is to not return on the matter in the foreseeable future. The better
the agreement, the less likely it needs to be renegotiated. Like stated
previously, negotiating is mentally taxing and may require substantial
coordination with all the stakeholders.</p>
<p>In traditional agreements, the criteria takes the form of Terms &amp; Conditions.
While reading the book, I made the discovery that in the agile world, the
criteria should be expressed as the <em>Definition of Done</em> (DoD) for a particular
user story. It then requires only a little bit of reasoning to arrive at the
conclusion: a good DoD is an acceptance test that allows the team to state with
confidence that the software works as intended.</p>
<p>This is a far better approach to work than spending time estimating it, as
highlighted by Jeff Sutherland himself (see the attached twitter post), and has
sort of revolutionized how I approach my work.</p>
<p>I have found that building the confidence to deploy working software to
production is the proper job of a Lead Developer. It is what ties everything
together. While it would be beneficial that we had more
<a href="https://davidepstein.com/range/">generalists</a>, we nonetheless live in a world
of specialists. There are the analysts who analyze, designers who design and
developers who develop. It then takes somebody who specializes in giving the
work a direction. It takes somebody who sees the work as a manufacturing
pipeline whose end stage is deployment to production. Otherwise, we end up just
fooling ourselves. The agreements we reach have little value if they do not end
up benefiting a paying customer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To draw this lengthy blog to a conclusion, I would summarize what I have learned
in the past 3 years as follows:</p>
<p>An agile sprint is an agreement to complete a piece of work. The content of that
piece of work is subject to negotiation among the team members. For there to be
a real negotiation, there should be a healthy conflict of interests. And for
there to be a productive negotiation, the conflict should not spill over so that
people take it personally. For this to even work in theory, true agility
requires a lot more back-scratching and amicable louse picking than is
physically possible after offshoring entire business segments beyond oceans. So
better be principled and insist on working with people you know and trust.</p>
<p>It is evident that not all team members will be negotiating with equal fervor.
They should nonetheless be aware of their BATNA: the decision to not participate
should be a conscious one. Insisting on the piece of work to be done in the
sense of agile ideals of delivering a feature to end-users is also obviously
only an ideal. Yet, I would start to measure agility by inspecting how close to
this ideal the Definition of Done of a particular piece of work is. The closer
it is to actual production deployment, the more principled the team is.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the deeper aspects of agile retrospectives is to raise awareness
of the habits the team has. Habits are extremely costly to change, but
confronting them honestly is at least a start. Ideally, good negotiation habits
should be present from the get-go. Principled negotiation strikes me as a good
platform to build upon. The theory has been literally battle-tested and should
work universally. It therefore captures something essential about the human
psyche.</p>
