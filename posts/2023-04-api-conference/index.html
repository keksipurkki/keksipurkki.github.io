  I put on my monocle and top hat and booked a ticket to London to attend my first
conference as a software developer. The topic of the
<a href="https://apiconference.net/app">conference</a> was APIs, i.e.  the stuff I develop
and design at work. The trip took place in late April 2023 under the auspices of
my employer, OP Financial Group. I attended a dozen or so lectures.  What
follows are the highlights of three of them.
</p>
<h4 id="the-myth-of-api-monetization---and-how-companies-really-create-business-value-with-apis">The Myth of API Monetization - and How Companies Really Create Business Value With APIs</h4>
<p>The first keynote I attended was on API monetization, which is a topic that has
also been in the tech news lately. For example, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api">Twitter</a> has started to charge
fees, and pretty hefty ones at that, for access to their APIs. For individuals,
the price tag is \$100 per month. Access for enterprises costs \$42,000 per month.
Ouch!</p>
<p>The lecturer, <a href="https://api-university.com/start/team/">Matthias Biehl</a> from
API-University.com, advised against blindly following the big tech and aiming at
this kind of direct monetization.  Instead, one should look at the business
model of a company as a whole and take it from there. It is more often the case
that companies can make good money out of their APIs through indirect means.</p>
<p>Well, kind of obvious, I thought to myself. But then again, I started to think
about the generic developer organization that is separated from the business end
to its own unit — something I criticized in my <a href="/posts/better-code-nov-2022/">previous
post</a>. Without visibility to production and not
having compensation levels that reflect the bottom line of the business, the
developers are in danger of adopting a &ldquo;cost center mentality.&rdquo; It is then very
difficult to see how APIs can generate income.</p>
<p>This realization in turn made me rather grateful for the way our business unit
at OP is organized. Stress-free it is not, but you get to see how a bank
operates from close range which is basically a mental exercise in following the
multiple levels of indirections of money as it circulates in the economy. The
agile demos we have typically involve a segment called the &ldquo;latest figures&rdquo; from
the business side. Heck, nowadays I even know what &ldquo;top line&rdquo; means!</p>
<p>The lecture provided me with a nice closure to the debates I have had with my
colleagues over the years. You see, there was a time when I wanted to design
APIs for the sake of APIs. And I truly believed that we could profit from my
work by simply going to some kind of an admin console and flicking a switch to
charge the API clients as a kind of crowning achievement in the end. Then I
learned that the situation is a bit more complex. Banking is a business built on
trust, and a sure way to destroy it is to surprise the customer with stunts like
that. On the other hand, a free solution can actually cause more harm than good,
because it can start to cannibalize the business of a completely different
business segment. But then, too costly APIs are not good either because they
encourage API clients to cut corners and use non-compliant techniques like
screen scraping.</p>
<p>The wisdom of banking APIs and monetization is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N4UFl9G00A">&ldquo;Do not ever get between a man
and his meal.&rdquo;</a> The purpose of APIs
in finance, or in retail banking at least, is to lubricate the economy. When
API-driven payments work well, the economy can run smoothly. And when the
economy runs smoothly, companies make money. And when companies make money, they
can actually pay back their loans instead of defaulting — the worry #1 for any
banker. And when they pay back their loans, they pay it back with an interest —
which is how a bank makes money.</p>
<h4 id="putting-yourself-out-there---how-to-secure-your-public-apis">Putting Yourself Out There - How to Secure Your Public APIs</h4>
<p>The next lecture of interest focused on API security and was given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan%2Derez%2D8971891/">Dan
Erez</a> from AT&amp;T. This is an
important topic but a bit involved to explain in simple terms to the
uninitiated. The difficulty is that the devil is truly in the details, and I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s only in my domain where security is really taken seriously.</p>
<p>The lecture highlighted some of the classic subtleties regarding exploitable
code. Often it is a case of exposing too much data. This can mean either too
much in the sense of violating the principle of least privilege, or too much in
the sense of allowing clients to request for arbitrary amounts of data, thereby
exhausting the server and causing a denial of service.</p>
<p>Other aspects of API security that were covered were the mechanisms by which we
can harden our APIs. How TLS 1.3 provides Perfect Forward Secrecy is for example
a nasty question I could ask in a job interview. How to implement mTLS is
another. And finally there&rsquo;s network level access control and network
segmentation that are highly relevant topics in banking.</p>
<p>A particular highlight of the lecture was the mentioning of
<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP</a>. If API security is a topic that
you find daunting and too abstract, I definitely recommend checking out
<a href="https://github.com/Checkmarx/capital">Checkmarx</a>. It is basically a
puzzle/reference app that provides you with a concrete examples of what
vulnerabilities look like in practice.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to harden the security of our APIs. This is required already
by legislation such as the PSD2 directive. I felt therefore relieved that our
public APIs at OP tick basically all the boxes when it came to the best
practices presented by Erez. Perhaps this goes to show that &ldquo;what gets
regulated, gets done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another mark of API security maturity has to do with the old adage &ldquo;what is
measured, gets managed.&rdquo; If I was to audit an API, I would not look at the code;
I would audit the ways of working of the development team.</p>
<p>You see, it takes keen eyes to spot a line of code that is exploitable, and it&rsquo;s
the nature of a human being to become blind to code. It therefore takes a joint
effort by a team software developers to build secure APIs.  Basically, you have
to have the mindset of a baddie to be a goodie. Given that most teams cannot
even agree on whether to use tabs or spaces for indentation, is it then any
wonder that the products they ship are infested with security issues?</p>
<h3 id="browsers-are-the-new-containers">Browsers are the new containers!</h3>
<p>The most interesting presentation of the conference was the second lecture by
Dan Erez. It is pretty evident by now that going serverless offers some pretty
big benefits in the world of distributed computing. For example, the
vulnerabilities in the runtime OS are not really a concern of a software
development team, and if the patching of the runtime images can be delegated to
the cloud provider, it&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>Yet, like I pointed out in my <a href="/posts/cloud-native/">cloud native post</a>, the
contingencies of adopting the serverless paradigm are just too worrisome for any
architect worth of their salt. A self-inflicted denial of service due to a
vendor lock-in sounds just like the dystopian reality George Orwell could have
written about if he had known REST APIs.</p>
<figure style="float:right; width:40%; margin-right: 0.25em;">
  <img alt="Matrix meme" src="/free_cloud.jpg" />
  <figcaption><small>A lead architect from the dystopian future.</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using a Matrix meme picture, Erez then asks &ldquo;What if I told you that you already
have a free cloud?&rdquo; The basic idea would be to leverage the existing compute
capacity of a company by distributing computations to the workstations and
laptops it already owns. Further, the computation would take place in the
sandboxed runtime environment of the browser. After all, all devices have a
browser and most devices are actually idle most of the time.</p>
<p>My immediate response was: &ldquo;This sounds so wack it must be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erez pointed out the <a href="https://www.seti.org/">SETI project</a> from the 1990s as an example where volunteers
leased their computer for the search of extraterrestrial intelligence. He
further painted a picture of a web3.0 world where we could get rid of the cloud
providers for good. Instead, all clients in the network could participate in
revenue sharing by leasing their computers to do the computations servers
currently do.</p>
<p>Perhaps at this point it pays to read aloud the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">8 fallacies of
distributed
computing</a> to
remind oneself what the issues are. It is perhaps also instructive to take a
look at Roy Thomas Fielding&rsquo;s original doctoral dissertation on <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf">REST
Architecture</a>,
and how it specifically argues for a client—server model.</p>
<p>However, the idea of offloading computations to the client device is not
completely without merit. I would water down the idea a bit, and tie the
discussion to the architecture of the so-called &lsquo;mobile super-app&rsquo;. It is a
mobile app that gets some its code dynamically from the back-end, and can for
example act as a host for &lsquo;miniapps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I was involved with such a P2P payment app some years ago. The contract was that
the miniapps were written in JavaScript and would execute in their own React
Native sandbox. The miniapps were versioned and could be independently deployed
to the host app.</p>
<p>Sadly, the miniapps had limited use and we somehow could not realize their full
potential. However, the basic idea remains interesting.  Nowadays I could
envision some kind of a &ldquo;bring your own server&rdquo; mobile app, that would be split
to a frontend and serverless backend that would largely execute in the mobile
app itself. I imagine an app that would receive an instruction stream from the
server. Much like the OS syscalls, the server could instruct the app to execute
<em>serverless functions</em> in the frontend. And like kernel code that executes in
kernel context, the serverless functions could execute under the <em>security
context</em> of the end user.</p>
<p>The offloaded serverless functions could be for example WebAssembly that the app
would update and cache as needed. The connection to the instruction stream could
be a WebSocket connection.</p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that not only is computation distributed but we
would also distribute identity management. The user identity could be backed by
a key pair whose private part could be stored securely on the mobile device,
many of which have tailored hardware for this purpose. Network requests from the
serverless functions could then be authorized using strong cryptography.</p>
<p>Going further, Erez&rsquo;s lecture inspired me to think that web3.0 could be a thing
in the end. It just got on a bad foot due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7OZld47K4">&ldquo;cryptoshit&rdquo;</a>. If the user data
would disappear once the user uninstalls an app, the user&rsquo;s right to be
forgotten would be trivially satisfied. I would also imagine that people would
start to treat their data much like physical currency. I do not know about you,
but I would actually find this a positive outcome.</p>
