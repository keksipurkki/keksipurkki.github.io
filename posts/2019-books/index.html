        <p>New year, new gear. Time to reflect on the lessons learned during 2019, a year
that I remember from its warm and pleasant summer, Greta Thunberg and raising
awareness of climate change, Brexit drama, and the &ldquo;stable ingenuity&rdquo; of Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, one of the highlights of the year was that I left
Europe for the first time in my life for a summer holiday in California, USA. I
traveled alone, even though a travel companion or a gang would have been
awesome. Luckily there's one thing a solo traveller can do at their leisure
that's not so convenient when travelling in company. And that is to binge-read
books.</p>
<p>I read physical books quite infrequently in my 20's because I was hooked on
Wikipedia and my studies took their toll, too. However, I have picked up reading
again in recent years. One of the sources of happiness I have discovered is
reading in my bed at night by the light of a dim lamp. I have a hunch this might
be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pm0Mn0-jYU">hygge</a> the Danish talk
about.</p>
<p>I read just for the sake of reading, often times just by opening a book in the
middle and following along for a chapter or two. Poetry, mathematics and
philosophy work best for this purpose. They make you might drowsy, too. Every
once in a while a captivating piece of work comes along that I simply devour
from head to tail. Here are 5 such books that I read in 2019 and my &ldquo;review&rdquo;
about them.</p>
<h3 id="1-juha-hurme-niemi-the-cape">1. Juha Hurme: Niemi (The Cape)</h3>
<p>I read Juha Hurme's Niemi in the desert surroundings of Joshua Tree, CA, and boy
was it a good book. In it, Hurma lays out the history of Finland, starting from
the Big Bang, dinosaurs and tectonic movements. Think of the book as sort of the
literary version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub747pprmJ8">Right Here, Right Now by Fatboy
Slim</a> but with a Finnish twist.</p>
<p>The book zeroes in the cultural history of an area it calls &ldquo;The Cape&rdquo;. It is
Finland of course, but calling it that would bring on all the baggage of
nationalism, and indeed, it seems that people in this part of the world did not
see t</p>
<p>Hurma
biographies of Finnish-Swedish humanists. However, a key point is that the book
references the area we</p>
<p>A particularly laudable aspect of the book is its focus on many unsung heroes
that are . These people lived in the era that does not</p>
<img src="/2010-books-01.png">
<p>This seems to be a particular interest of . As he is also an active playwright, we are also
treated with theatrical performances of the same content. The play <em>Europaeus</em>
that is about the humanist <strong>Daniel Europaeus</strong> and the play <em>Making of Lea</em>
about the gang that made the first ever Finnish-speaking play</p>
<p>In my opinion, the book is also a commentary about the present time, where
humanists lurk unemployed in the shadows, technocrats rule and right-wing
popularism is on the rise.</p>
<p>If you live in Finland and want to be assured that humanism is not dead, check
out Hurme's works. You will notice that he's style of writing is marked by some
mannerisms that might be a bit vulgar for the literature connoisseur / grammar
Nazis (i.e. comma fuckers in plain good Finnish).</p>
<p>In the language of California, my response is &ldquo;I feel you brah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>, like the abrupt use of Helsinki slang in otherwise factual</p>

<h3 id="5-daniel-kahnemann-thinking-fast-and-slow">5. Daniel Kahnemann: Thinking, Fast and Slow</h3>
<p>Widely known and praised in my circles, Daniel Kahnemann's &ldquo;Thinking, Fast and
Slow&rdquo; first came to my attention on a company cruise to Tallinn. We older . The
youngest member in our party</p>
