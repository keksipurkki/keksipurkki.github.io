        <p>New year, new gear. Time to reflect on the lessons learned during 2019, a year
that I remember from its warm and pleasant summer, Greta Thunberg and climate
anxiety, Brexit drama, and the &ldquo;stable genius&rdquo; of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>On a personal note, one of the highlights of the year was that I left Europe for
the first time for a summer holiday in California, USA. I traveled alone, even
though a travel companion or an entourage of such would have been nice. Luckily
there&rsquo;s one thing a solo traveller can do at their leisure that&rsquo;s not so
convenient when travelling in company. And that is to binge-read books 🤓.</p>
<p>I read books in their physical form quite infrequently in my 20&rsquo;s because I was
hooked on Wikipedia and too preoccupied with my studies. However, I have picked
up reading again in recent years. One of the sources of happiness I have
discovered is reading in bed at night by the light of a dim lamp. I have a hunch
this might be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pm0Mn0-jYU">hygge</a> the
Danish talk about.</p>
<p>I read just for the sake of reading, often times just by opening a book in the
middle and following along for a chapter or two. Poetry, mathematics and
philosophy work best for this purpose. They make you mighty drowsy, too. Every
once in a while a captivating piece of work comes along that I simply devour
from head to tail.</p>
<p>One of those books that I read in 2019 was <a href="http://www.teos.fi/kirjat/kaikki/2017-syksy/niemi.html">Niemi (The Cape) by Juha
Hurme</a>.</p>
<p><img style="width:40%;display:inline;float:left;margin:0.25rem 1rem 0.25rem 0rem;"
src="/juhahurme-niemi.min.jpg"></p>
<p>I read The Cape in the desert surroundings of Joshua Tree, CA, and boy was it
good. In it, Hurme lays out the history of Finland, starting from the Big Bang,
dinosaurs and tectonic movements. Think of it as the literary version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub747pprmJ8">Right
Here, Right Now by Fatboy Slim</a> but
with a Finnish twist.</p>
<p>After a brief overview of the universe, the book zeroes in on an area it calls
the &ldquo;Cape.&rdquo; It is Finland, but calling it that would drag along all the baggage
of nationalism, so the author took the liberty of rechristening what was called
East Sweden by the contemporaries as the Cape. This makes sense as the whole
notion of Finland was pretty much invented in the early 1800s where the book
ends. Before that, Finland referred to the province that is now called Finland
Proper.</p>
<p>The choice for the scope of the book is laudable, as it allows Hurme to focus on
the centuries and many unsung heroes that are virtually unknown to Finns. A good
example is <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfridus_Aronus_Forsius">Sigfridus Aronus
Forsius</a>. The dude was
mental.</p>
<p>As Hurme is also an active playwright, we are also treated with plays about the
same content. The plays
<a href="https://www.ntamo.net/product/694/juha-hurme-europaeus"><em>Europaeus</em></a> and
<a href="https://www.kom-teatteri.fi/makingoflea.html"><em>Making of Lea</em></a> about the
humanist <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._D._Europaeus">Daniel Europaeus</a>
and the first Finnish-speaking theatrical group headed by <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaarlo_Bergbom">Kaarlo
Bergbom</a> are examples that come to
my mind.</p>
<p>Literary pioneers seem to be a particularly keen topic for Hurme, and I do not wonder
why. Stories about rebel underdogs who went against the grain and never got a
chance to be included in the canon of high culture are obviously interesting and
therefore worth telling.</p>
<img style="width:60%;display:inline;float:right;margin:0.25rem 1rem;" src="/2019-books-01.png">
<p>In addition, Finns tend to have a rather nationalistic view of the world and
history. The problem with this is that it leads to a worldview that is quite
close to the diagram shown by Conan O&rsquo;Brian back in 2006 when he took a liking
to our country and our president Tarja Halonen. The diagram summarized Finnish
history with three points: Finland is settled, Nokia starts making cell phones
and the present. It would seem that nothing happened in the intervening millennia.</p>
<p>The book tries to fill the gap and alternates between biographies of
Finnish-Swedish thinkers and Hurme&rsquo;s interpretations of historical writings and
poems. The text samples are firsthand evidence about the development of ideas
and ideologies at our latitudes. It was a very slow process.</p>
<p>Hurme&rsquo;s delivery is his typical and lively verbal fireworks but his commentary
also reveals a more serious and political side. As Hurme has us to believe,
ultimately nothing is indigenous to Finland and therefore purely Finnish.
Everything, including the mythology behind <em>Kalevala</em> and the instrument
<em>kantele</em>, is imported goods. Let that sink in for a while.</p>
<p>If anything, the one original feature of the people inhabiting the Cape was
their stubbornness in adopting novelties other than new vices. The people of the
Cape, especially non-lay, had an unbalanced and misguided view of the world
surrounding them. For example, the study of angels was promoted to its own
science before the enlightenment, and the text samples from the clergy at the
time make for a cringeworthy reading.</p>
<p>Reading through the lines, the book is also a commentary about our time, in
which humanists lurk in the fringes of the society, technocrats rule and
right-wing popularism caters to the unemployed leftovers. Contrasting the
rhetoric of present day nationalists with the puritanical preachings of the
1600s about the end of the world and noticing how they are constructed
essentially from the same illogical ingredients is reassuring. One needs a
factual and balanced worldview. Bullshit is bullshit.</p>
<p>Yet, Hurme is a clear fan of Finland. His thinking goes beyond nationalism to a
more inclusive and balanced view of us as a natural part of the world and the
universe. And that world is not immutable. I believe this is his core message.
<em>Nihil novi sub sole.</em></p>
<p>If you too are a fan of Finland, make Hurme your homeboy. You will notice that
his language is marked by some mannerisms that might be a bit annoying for the
pedantic reader. Often times it seems that he cuts verbal corners by throwing in
slang or dialectical (Häme?) expressions in the middle of otherwise factual
content. Another of his manners is to sneak in his own analyses and
interpretations of poems under the guise of narration. You feel like you&rsquo;re
reading his diary notes in the middle of a book that is supposed to be
non-fiction in some broad definition of the word. As I am personally not so
lyrically nuanced and never found Finnish folklore that cool, I can only respond
to Hurme&rsquo;s poem analyses in the language of California, &ldquo;I feel you brah!&rdquo;</p>
