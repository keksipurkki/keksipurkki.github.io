        <h2 id="would-it-be-time-to-give-maths-a-second-chance">Would it be time to give maths a second chance?</h2>
<p>Every now and then I come across social media campaigns and the like that aim to
inspire non-techies to take on programming. While I praise their goal, these
campaigns tend to have one thing in common that makes me cringe. They try to be
inclusive at the cost perpetuating a misguided image of the role of maths in
software development. The sentiment is that you do not need maths to become a
software developer.</p>
<img alt="Find x" style="float:right;" src="/find_x.jpg">
<p>I do not spend my time at work looking for <em>x</em>. It is a rare occasion if I get
to divide two numbers — after <code>null</code> and <code>NaN</code> checks of course. Practically
none of the stuff I do at work requires any maths.</p>
<p>So I have to concur that you do not really <em>need</em> maths for programming, but my
gripe is that the question is so loaded with prejudices that a simple <em>no</em> for
an answer is not sufficient. And I bet the INTJ death stare accompanying my
answer does not lighten the atmosphere either.</p>
<p>You see, I find maths absolutely crucial for programming <em>well</em>, and I doubt if
people are really that bad at it in the end.</p>
<p>Not that you can flip some switch and suddenly become a math wizard, but I think
the whole thing just goes to show how people&rsquo;s perception of maths is based on
unfortunate circumstances at school.</p>
<p>The problem is that we let education systems define what being good at maths
means at a very delicate stage in our development. Children are even divided
into groups by adults based on their performance. If you suck by the education
system standards, you are singled out, and their policy will not be to pick you
up. They will either dumb down the lectures, which you will notice, or give you
more of the same. If you are somebody who finds sitting still difficult, too bad
for you! You will carry the &lsquo;I suck at maths&rsquo; label for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I cannot give you a hero&rsquo;s story in which I would have struggled with maths and
finally, after much strife, would have excelled. I did not give the subject much
of a thought before university, and those times I did, I found it fascinating.
Then as an adult, I have gotten to the point where I can safely say that I am a
happy dilettante with no real skills to actually tackle mathematical problems. I
use camomile tea and YouTube math lectures as a natural substitute for Valium.</p>
<p>So, I can only imagine what it feels like to learn to doubt your maths skills
and consequently learn to detest the subject, for this is the pattern I see.
There&rsquo;s the doubt and then there&rsquo;s the hate.</p>
<p>It takes brains to do maths. Ours is a social one. Perhaps here lies the crux of
the problem. The natural state of affairs is that kids learn social behavior in
their peer group with adults being the caretakers who&rsquo;ll accept you back once
the day is done. When kids socialize, the rules of the play emerge
spontaneously. Kids practice negotiating social situations through play.</p>
<p>Maths is different. Maths is abstract and its rules are not set by the peer
group. The rules of maths are of the form &ldquo;given <em>X</em>, then <em>Y</em>.&rdquo; If you get
stuck at <em>X</em>, you are asking for trouble. The whole point is that <strong>if</strong> <em>X</em>
holds, then <em>Y</em> follows, and the proof is in the pudding. Never mind how <em>X</em>
came to be.</p>
<p>Associating difficulties in maths with difficulties in abstract thinking is a
no-brainer, but the more I think about it, refusal of the basic formula of a
mathematical statement seems to be the one problem that rules them all.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s the agony of getting stuck in irrelevant details. I have great
many examples of this from my own life, but I want to share an anecdote from the
world of adult education recounted to me by my mother who is a teacher. Her
maths teacher colleague was going over the geometrical properties of the circle
and illustrated them on the blackboard. The problem was she drew the circle in a
sloppy way. One of the adult students raised their hand and pointed this out.
The teacher assured that this is not a problem — we can assume that the circle
is drawn perfectly. &ldquo;But why, I never thought of that!&rdquo;, replied the student.
&ldquo;All my life I thought you had to draw shapes perfectly in order to study them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another variation of the theme is difficulties accepting a proposition because
of aversion of authority figures. I have met so many people in my life who claim
they suck at maths because they were at odds with their maths teacher. I think
this is a case where the person found it difficult to toggle between the maths
and social contexts of their brain. If a child or a teenager tries to learn
maths in the social mode, it will appear that it is the adult who &ldquo;sets the
rules&rdquo; which is a conflict. &ldquo;I do not accept <em>X</em> because it was you who proposed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third and final example that in my experience bites us adults the hardest is
of the form &lsquo;if not entertaining, then zero f*cks given.&rsquo; Kids and adults
alike enjoy solving puzzles for a dopamine rush. Maths is also a treasure trove
of interesting historical anecdotes that relate to technology, like the birth of
geometry in ancient Egypt to deal with land disputes after the Nile flooded. The
problem with puzzles and stories is that maths is not about them: it is about
the connection between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. To truly enjoy maths, you want to be rather
high…in Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs 😅. You want to study maths for its own
sake.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s do a bit of a reset and let go of the grudges against the poor maths
teacher who is senile by now anyway. And let&rsquo;s not immediately assume there has
to be some shiny prize at the end of doing a bit of maths. If you were to give
maths a second chance, what should you know if you want to become a software
developer?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it boils down to developing your intuition not just about the
craft of designing data structures and algorithms, but the world of abstract
things as a whole. It is nice to see where programming sits in the universe of
geekiness. I could probably write the rest of my life on this topic, but let
me just develop a couple of arguments with pointers to interesting stuff I have
encountered on my math lecture adventures.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-not-so-different-from-software-design">It is not so different from software design</h2>
<p>Maths is made of a multitude of disciplines. Some of them are more mainstream,
some are more esoteric. Every discipline comes with its own concepts and theory.
If you want an overview of how the different mainstream areas mesh together, you
may watch this piece of awesomeness:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y">link</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience, no mathematical result will help you directly to write a
single line of code. And I have my doubts about every piece of software produced
by academics. So you could just yell &ldquo;YAGNI: You ain&rsquo;t gonna need it.&rdquo;
But hold on, remember we should not look solely for utility? Let&rsquo;s consider the
good ol&rsquo; format &lsquo;given <em>X</em>, then <em>Y</em>&rsquo; but with a twist. What happens if the <em>X</em>
part gets more and more elaborate?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a set <em>G</em> and operation · satisfying the group laws, the tuple (G,·)
forms a group.</li>
<li>An abelian group is one for which <em>g<sub>i</sub>·g<sub>j</sub>=g<sub>j</sub>·g<sub>i</sub></em>
for all group elements in <em>G</em>.</li>
<li>Let <em>F</em> be a set. Given an additive abelian group (F,+) and multiplicative
abelian group (F — {0}, ×), the tuple (F,+,×) forms a field.</li>
</ul>
<p>While every statement on the list is true, I hope that they are gibberish to
you. Naming things concisely and expressively is hard not only when it comes to
code. But the other side of the coin is that sometimes certain concepts just
have to be understood before you can make further progress. If you want to
understand what a field is, you first need to understand what an abelian group
is. And to understand abelian groups, you need to understand groups in general.</p>
<p>The classification and hierarchy of structures is what mathematics ends up
being. We arrange the structures into levels of abstraction to see patterns that
are otherwise lost in details. You can classify and arrange the pieces to see
different patterns. It is ultimately up to you, as long as you are honest and
stick to the <em>Y</em> follows from <em>X</em> format.</p>
<p>All of this has a major bearing to writing software well. It is not so much the
mathematical results but the art of thinking systematically at different levels
of abstraction.</p>
<p>It is for example important to understand the notion of <em>referential
transparency</em> that states that you can search-and-replace, i.e. inline, the term
<em>group laws</em> above with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">actual equations that define a
group</a>. It is equally
important to understand that doing so will introduce unnecessary details to the
discussion. You pick the level of abstraction that is suitable at every
particular context.</p>
<p>From software architect&rsquo;s point of view, it is also important to understand that
there are many ways to layer and organize a software system. Some serve a
functional purpose while others a non-functional one. Some are present at
(micro)service level, some at class method level. It is like looking at a map at
different resolutions or turning the whole map upside down. Or maybe let&rsquo;s not
turn a map upside down, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Another aspect of mathematical theories relates to the way in which they emerge.
You see, mathematics is discovered, not invented. This too has a great parallel
with software development, for the only way to construct a complex piece of
software is to discover its laws that often times relate directly to the
physical world around us.</p>
<p>It is only by discovering the algorithms and data structures that you can
distinguish between accidental and essential complexity, which is one of the
core skills of a software developer. And when it comes to data in the real
world, why would you reject mathematically battle tested structures over
something you roll on your using magical strings?</p>
<p>And what do we do when things go awry? Treating a program like a mathematical
proof, we rewind the argument to a point where we still understand what is going
on. We literally pause the execution of a program with a debugger and follow its
execution step by step until the bug is found. It is not so different from
following a mathematical proof.</p>

<p>A computer is essentially a device that has two components called CPU and RAM.
The job of the CPU is to write and read bit sequences to and from the RAM. The
job of the RAM is to store those bit sequences. The stream of bit sequences from
the RAM to the CPU is made of instructions and data. The instructions tell the
CPU how the data is to be manipulated.</p>
<p>I bet if you are reading this blog post you are a tech-savvy person and knew
this much. By inspecting the picture on the right, you can also infer that it&rsquo;s
depicting a computer with a 8-bit architecture. That is, a computer that
manipulates data one byte at a time.</p>
<p>The actual computation inside the CPU happens practically instantaneously and it
takes time to shuffle the bits around. And if we were to extend the discussion
to hard drives and network, the timescales blow up big time. In reality, CPUs
end up idling most of the time. It is a relatively rare occurrence for the CPU
to do anything smart.</p>
<p>And once the CPU has a hold of a piece of data, what can it do with it? Take the
derivative? Compute an integral? The technicality to understand is that the CPU
reads data to so-called registers. For example, the registers might be 16-bit
wide so that the above 8-bit machine would require two reads to fill it with
bits. For the computer to be feature complete, it needs to be able to first read
data to its register and then, after manipulating it, write the modified content
back to memory. A 16-bit register has <em>2<sup>16</sup></em> inputs that map to
<em>2<sup>16</sup></em> outputs. That&rsquo;s it. In a way, the CPU does not know what it is
doing beyond the instruction it is currently executing.</p>
<p>It is the job of computer programs to store instructions in the correct order to
produce meaningful bit sequences in the memory. What is the role of maths here?
What are the instructions to transform e.g. a 16-bit sequence to any other
16-bit sequence.</p>
<p>The question can be understood in two ways. We can talk either about the
instruction set, the total number of instructions that the CPU understands, or
the number of instructions to sequence to compute the desired outcome. If you
think about this for a while, you will realize that this is a balancing act. The
two approaches are a design with a handful of instructions that need to be
sequenced or a lot of specialized instructions that get a particular bit
transformation done in one go.</p>
<p>Taken to the extreme, one can actually realize a working computer with just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer">one
instruction</a>:
flipping bits one at a time. Sure, it will be retarded, but hey, no difficult
maths was involved!</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s an electrical engineer&rsquo;s take on maths in programming. Would you like
to have a program that takes one gigabyte of hard disk on your smartphone and
takes an eternity to run or one that takes up say a megabyte or two and runs
hella fast?</p>
<p>Introducing logic!</p>
<p>Thanks to logic, we can design instruction sets that work universally. We can
frame all &ldquo;computation&rdquo; that the CPU can do in terms of a handful of binary
operations and the bit flip, also know as logical negation. Take for example the
logical operation called <em>XOR</em>, the exclusive or. Its truth table is on the
right.</p>
<p>The <em>XOR</em> of <em>11111111</em> and <em>00000000</em> is computed bitwise and the answer is
<em>11111111</em>. Now you can for example clear a register to all zero bits by
computing the <em>XOR</em> of its content with itself.</p>
<p>You can write down all the other possible truth tables by permuting the output
bits: <em>2<sup>4</sup></em> in total. That would suggest that we would require 16
instructions on two operands and the negation instruction plus the instructions
for reading and writing to memory. The reality is a bit more nuanced. For
example, you may not want to use the logical operation of <em>contradiction</em> and
it turns out that many of logical operations are actually redundant.</p>

<p>I hope  you are convinced that kind of maths involved here is dead simple. You
apply the same logical rules over and over again until the desired result has
been achieved. Indeed, a little logic will go a long way.</p>
<h2 id="theres-no-escaping-it">There&rsquo;s no escaping it</h2>
<p>Let us finally take an intuitionistic stance to the topic. You cannot ultimately
escape maths. No matter how much you dislike it, you still want to be understood
by others, right? Turns out that programming and human languages are both
instances of &ldquo;first-order predicate calculus&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s one of those fancy
abstract maths words, but it just means &ldquo;the theory of logical languages of
practical utility in the real world&rdquo;. For you to fit into a social group, you
have to make sense of yourself. Some exceptions to the rule apply to the social
contract of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JmA2ClUvUY">infants</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6uXbiYk8iU">drunkards</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/s-mOy8VUEBkhttps://youtu.be/s-mOy8VUEBk">Danish
people</a>.</p>
<p>And since the act of forming any sentence involves maths, you start to wonder if
we can even perceive anything at all that would not have some mathematical
structure behind it. I can only imagine the most primordial of things like pain.
But then again, doing maths makes my brain hurt some times&hellip;</p>
<p>No matter how trivial, chaotic or random, mathematicians have tried to tackle
it. Not that maths is a panacea. On the contrary, there are great many fields of
maths that are so difficult that nobody has made any progress in over a century
and consequently you can be as wise as the next door university professor just
by understanding the problem statement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg">Collatz conjecture</a> comes to
my mind as a nice real world example. In general, buzzwords like &rsquo;nonlinearity&rsquo;,
&lsquo;chaos&rsquo; and &lsquo;curse of dimensionality&rsquo; are all related to phenomena that we as a
species just do not grasp very well. But do not be fooled by <em>randomness</em>.
Probability theory is one of most beautiful things I have ever seen and that, my
friend, we have locked down.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s flip the script. There are aspects of reality that we understand
effortlessly, some require practice, and the nonlinear bits trip us every time.
Maths requires effort and is able to describe complexity to the extent that we
can make sense of it. You do not really need maths in programming, because in
general, we would like to craft systems that operate effortlessly. What is
perhaps sometimes extra, we would like the users of our systems to also interact
with them effortlessly — drunk infant Danes included.</p>
<p>But you nonetheless need maths to understand what it means to be a human. Maths
is the template language of human perception. It is the very language of
cultural evolution with no allegiance to any culture in particular, making it
resilient to human screw-ups like genocides.</p>
<p>Fragments of clay tablets showing how arithmetic was done millennia ago may be
hidden in the sand but are perfectly understandable once restored, just like
the shards of silicon that we will leave behind for future hominids to wrap
their heads around.</p>
